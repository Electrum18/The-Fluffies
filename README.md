<h2 align="center">Welcome to: The Fluffies! <img width="30" src="https://files.everypony.ru/smiles/09/de/61c292.png" alt="Smiling Fluttershy"></h2>

[The Fluffies](https://the-fluffies.net/) - this is an interactive web project - editor, based on the transformation of vector graphics and the power of web technologies.

## About
Make your own furry-cartoon creation with that service like vector image (`MLP:FIM - Ponies, in this time`).

### Open source web project in the development of which everyone can take part

Created in the summer of 2018 with the idea of ​​using vector animation right on the site and making it accessible to all by the editor.

If you are interested in drawing, programming and other activities, tell me, Electrum18, `I don’t have enough time to develop alone`.

The project is based on the `Nuxt.js framework` (made from `Vue.js` and `Webpack`) in `Statically Generated mode`.

A website is a `Single Page Application` (`SPA`), and also a `Progressive Web Application` (`PWA`).

`Vuetify` was used to write the interface.

The project supports `web sockets` (`socket.io`) for real-time elements.

Optimized for `use on phones` and in `non-network mode`.

### In future plans
- Adding `premium` features via donation
- Adding `gryphons` and `kirin` races

## Support us

### How to draw
- Frames use vector format (SVG), you need to take the coordinates of the shape from the file they are located at (digital sequence of text).

- All parts of the "avatar" are divided into frames, on average they are 3, 5, 7 horizontal frames (there are no vertical ones).

- In order for animation to work properly, it is necessary for points to be in right order, with the same quantity in frames, it is easy to observe if copied from the previous frame, afterwards providing changes for new one.
